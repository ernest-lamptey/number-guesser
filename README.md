## Number Guesser

For this project, I just created the functions in the 'script.js' file. All other files were already prepared.

Overall it is satisfying to see how adding a few lines of code can add core functionality to a program.

One of the project requirements was to pop up an alert whenever the user enters a number less than 0 or greather than 9. I was able to do that but the program still run after the alert message so I figured there was no use until later when I'm more confident to effect the requisite changes in the 'game.js' file.
